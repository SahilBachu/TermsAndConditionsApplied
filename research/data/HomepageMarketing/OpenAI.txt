OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Our vision is to ensure that artificial general intelligence—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity. We are building safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. Developing safe and beneficial AI requires people from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds. OpenAI consists of the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and the for-profit OpenAI Group. The Foundation governs the Group, which operates as a public benefit corporation. The OpenAI mission advances through the combined impact of both organizations.
