The FBI, with its law enforcement partners, plays a key role in combating violent crime involving gangs, crimes against children, crimes in Indian Country, fugitives and missing persons, kidnappings, and bank robberies. The FBI is the lead federal agency for investigating cyberattacks by criminals, overseas adversaries, and terrorists. The threat is incredibly serious—and growing. The FBI is dedicated to eliminating transnational organized crime groups that pose the greatest threat to the national and economic security of the United States. The FBI is the lead agency for exposing, preventing, and investigating intelligence activities, including espionage, in the U.S. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate investigates and works to prevent incidents involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical weapons. The FBI, the lead agency for enforcing civil rights law, aggressively investigates hate crime, color of law abuses by public officials, human trafficking and involuntary servitude, and freedom of access to clinic entrances violations. Public corruption poses a fundamental threat to our national security and way of life. White-collar crimes can destroy a company, wipe out a person's life savings, cost investors billions of dollars, and erode the public's trust in institutions.
