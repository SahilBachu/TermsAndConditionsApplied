Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 22, 2026



This Privacy Policy applies to TikTok services (the “Services”), which include TikTok apps, websites, software, and related services, accessed via any platform or device, that link to this Privacy Policy, as well as TikTok Ad Network. The Services are operated by TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC (“TikTok USDS Joint Venture”, “we” or “us”).

We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users and other individuals in connection with the Services. For information about how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process consumer health data as defined under Washington’s My Health My Data Act and other similar state laws, please refer to the Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.

Information We Collect
We collect your information in three ways: information that you provide, automatically collected information, and information from other sources. More detail is provided below.

When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information:

Account information, such as date of birth, username, password, email, phone number, and profile image.
User content, including comments, photographs, livestreams, audio recordings, videos, and text that you choose to create, import, upload, or publish through our apps and websites. Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in user content created or published by users on our apps and websites. We may collect user content through pre-uploading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or publish that user content, for example, to recommend audio options, provide an effect, generate captions, and provide other personalized recommendations.
Messages, including content you compose, send, or receive through our messaging functionalities, including messages you send through our chat functionality when using our shopping features to communicate with sellers.
AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.
Clipboard content, such as text and images, accessed through your device's clipboard when you choose to use certain functions such as initiating information sharing with third-party services, or copying and pasting clipboard content onto our apps and websites.
Purchase information, including payment card information, billing, delivery, and contact information, and purchase history when you make a purchase, payment, or other transaction on or through the Services, including when you buy TikTok Coins or purchase products or services through our shopping features.
Your phone and social network contacts, with your permission. If you choose to sync your contacts, we will collect information, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses from your device’s phone book, and friends list from your social network, and match that information to users who have TikTok accounts. We also collect information about the accounts you follow and that follow you.
Your account settings and communication preferences.
Information to verify an account such as proof of identity or age.
Information in correspondence you send to us, including when you contact us for support.

Information You Provide may include sensitive personal information, as defined under applicable state privacy laws, such as information from users under the relevant age threshold, information you disclose in survey responses or in your user content about your racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information. For example, we may process your financial information in order to provide you the goods or services you request from us or your driver’s license number in order to verify your identity. We may also collect precise location data, depending on your settings and as explained below. We process such sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable law, such as for permitted purposes under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

Automatically Collected Information
We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including:

You may submit a request to know, access, correct or delete the information we have collected from or about you here or by sending your request to the physical address provided in the “Contact Us” section below. You may appeal any decision we have made about your request through these same methods. Through your in-app settings, you can directly update your account information, request a copy of your data, or deactivate or delete your account by following the instructions for deactivation here or deletion here.

More information about requests that we have received can be found here.

You can also control the information we collect and opt out of certain activities in the following ways:

You may be able to control some of the Information We Collect by refusing or disabling cookies through your device browser settings. Because each browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your browser. Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable certain types of cookies. In addition, your choice to disable cookies is specific to the particular browser that you are using when you disable cookies, so you may need to separately disable cookies for each type of browser. Some browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites. Because of differences in how browsers incorporate and activate this feature, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. Please be aware that if you choose to refuse, disable, or delete cookies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you. Without this information, we are not able to provide you with all of the requested services.
If you have a TikTok account, you can navigate to “Ads” in your in-app settings to manage how your activity elsewhere online is used to serve you ads on our websites and apps. Using your in-app settings, you can also manage the ads that TikTok Ad Network serves you elsewhere online. If you do not have a TikTok account, you can manage the ads that TikTok Ad Network serves elsewhere online using the webform here, or through the ad notice that appears along with ads that are delivered by the TikTok Ad Network. Your device may have controls that determine what Information We Collect. For example, you can control whether we access your phone contacts in your device settings.
You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the “unsubscribe” link or mechanism noted in those emails.
Data Security and Retention
We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Services, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information such as your account registration information to provide you with the Services, we keep this information for as long as you have an account, subject to your updates of such information. If you violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other conditions or policies, we may remove you from the Services immediately, but may keep information about you to process the violation.

Subject to applicable laws, including Executive Order 14352 and any compliance obligations thereunder, we may transmit your information outside of the United States, for purposes of sharing with recipients as described in this Privacy Policy.

Children and Teens
The privacy of children is important to us. We provide a separate experience for users under age 13 (“Child” or “Children”) in the United States, in which we collect and process only limited information. Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy to learn more.

If we become aware that a Child’s personal information has been collected outside of this separate experience for Children, we will delete this information in accordance with applicable law and terminate the Child’s account. If you believe there is a user of the Services who is below the age of 13 (excluding any users of this separate experience for Children), please contact us at https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback.

As a parent or guardian, you can also request to delete the account of your Child or to download their data, by contacting us at https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy. Depending on your state of residence, you may also have the ability to exercise these rights over your teen’s account, or to exercise other rights in connection with your Child or teen by contacting us at https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy. We will address these requests in accordance with applicable law.
